Objective 
In this challenge, you'll work with arithmetic operators. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task 
Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost.

Note: Be sure to use precise values for your calculations, or you may end up with an incorrectly rounded result!

Input Format

There are  lines of numeric input: 
The first line has a double, meal_cost (the cost of the meal before tax and tip). 
The second line has an integer, tip_percent (the percentage of  being added as tip). 
The third line has an integer,  tax_percent(the percentage of  being added as tax).

Output Format

Print The total meal cost is totalCost dollars., where  is the rounded integer result of the entire bill ( with added tax and tip).

Sample Input

12.00
20
8
Sample Output

The total meal cost is 15 dollars.
Explanation

Given: 
meal_cost,  tip_percent,  tax_percent

Calculations: 
 
 
 

We round totalcost to the nearest dollar (integer) and then print our result:

The total meal cost is 15 dollars.
